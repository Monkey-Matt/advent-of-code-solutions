# advent-of-code 2022 & 2023

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [monkey-matt][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, monkey-matt is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

In most cases I've completed the tasks as fast as possible and then tidied up my solutions before committing them.
On some days I later go back and add an alternative solution that I find interesting after seeing how others have solved the problem. In particular watching [Kotlin by Jetbrains on youtube][kotlin by jetbrains]
